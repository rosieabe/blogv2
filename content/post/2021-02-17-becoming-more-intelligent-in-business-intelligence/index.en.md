2020 was definitely a year to remember. I try to remember the good and the bad together (more on that below). In this long and isolated time, I've taken some time to re-think what I'm good at, what I've learned, and what I can contribute publicly. I've decided to perhaps focus on business intelligence subjects, since that is the turn my career seems to have taken for now.

Oh also, I updated my hugo theme. It's rad, right? Luckily I had my first blogpost here to help guide my way.
