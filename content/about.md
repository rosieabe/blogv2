This site was built with `blogdown` and built to house my thoughts about data, analytics, work, and other topics that spark my interest.

`blogdown` makes use of Hugo, of which I'm leaving the original "About" below

Hugo is a static site engine written in Go.


It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [J Walter Weatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jWalterWeatherman)
* [Cast](https://github.com/spf13/cast)

## Setup

Some fun facts about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](https://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](https://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](https://vim.spf13.com/)
